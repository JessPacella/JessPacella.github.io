        <p class="article-paragraph intro">New York Times columnist and author, Andrew Ross Sorkin, has been described as
                "the most famous financial journalist of his generation." A leading voice on Wall Street and corporate America, his New York Times bestseller, <em>Too Big to Fail</em>, was the first true
                behind-the-scenes, moment-by-moment account of how the financial crisis developed into a global tsunami.</p>

        <p class="article-paragraph">The Economist, The Financial Times, and Business Week all named <em>Too Big To Fail</em> one of the best books of
                the year. The book was published by Viking October 20, 2009. The book was adapted as a movie by HBO Films and
                premiered on HBO on May 23, 2011. The film was directed by Curtis Hanson, and the screenplay was written by Peter Gould.</p>

        <p class="cite"><cite>Julia Keller, Chicago Tribune</cite></p>

        <p class="article-paragraph">"Sorkin's prodigious reporting and lively writing put the reader in the room for some of the biggest-dollar conference calls in history. It's an entertaining, brisk book."</p>
